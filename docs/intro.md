# About CIROH

**CIROH** supports **NOAA and the National Weather Service** with research strength to advance the U.S. capability for operational hydrological forecasting of floods, droughts, and water quality. As a consortium of 28 academic, government, and commercial institutions, CIROH will enable transformational change within the **hydrology** community by advancing community water modeling and collaborative hydrologic research.

## Mission

To **innovate** research that enhances our understanding of how coupled atmosphere-oceanland-biosphere components interact hydrologically and transform this new knowledge into **operational research** products benefitting society.

## Vision

CIROH is a leading translator of **world-class water science research to operations**, putting actionable water intelligence in the hands of those managing floods, droughts, and water quality. CIROH empowers researchers, scientists, and learners of all types to understand hydrologic science, build community resilience to water-related hazards, and produce benefits for society.

## Core Capabilities

- Simulating hydrological phenomena with linked terrestrial and coastal models and advancing methods for water resources forecasting to inform life-saving decisions.
- Prototyping operational forecasting improvements in the model workflow to support extension of next generation water modeling for a national community of hydrological users.
- Leveraging process advancements and modeling improvements to create tools and applications to deliver actionable water resources intelligence to engage a broad array of stakeholders in management, operations, and emergency response.
- Improving strategies, methods, and tools for the delivery and efficacy of communication and decision support services through applied social science research, community resilience planning, stakeholder engagement; and risk perception and communication research.
- Providing education, outreach, and engagement opportunities in NOAA-related research on applications of hydrological processes, communication, and decision-making to support student participation in areas that will cultivate a desire and capabilities to join the future workforce in NOAA.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
